ToxPred : a toxic peptide predictor 

## Overview
Over the past few decades, scientific research has been focused on developing peptide/protein-based therapies to treat various diseases. With several advantages over small molecules, including high specificity, high penetration, ease of manufacturing, peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic molecules against many diseases. However, one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is its toxicity. Therefore, in the present app, we aimed to predict the toxicity of peptides and proteins by exploiting NLP and molecular graph information for a given input sequence.
